If provided, it must have\\n    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,\\n    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a\\n    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.\\nwhere : array_like, optional\\n    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the\\n    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.\\n    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.\\n    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default\\n    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will\\n    remain uninitialized.\\n**kwargs\\n    For other keyword-only arguments, see the\\n    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.\\n\\nReturns\\n-------\\ny : ndarray\\n    The natural logarithm of `x`, element-wise.\\n    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.\\n\\nSee Also\\n--------\\nlog10, log2, log1p, emath.log\\n\\nNotes\\n-----\\nLogarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite\\nnumber of `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the\\n`z` whose imaginary part lies in `(-pi, pi]`.\\n\\nFor real-valued input data types, `log` always returns real output. For\\neach value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it\\nyields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.\\n\\nFor complex-valued input, `log` is a complex analytical function that\\nhas a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log`\\nhandles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative\\nnumber, conforming to the C99 standard.\\n\\nIn the cases where the input has a negative real part and a very small\\nnegative complex part (approaching 0), the result is so close to `-pi`\\nthat it evaluates to exactly `-pi`.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n..
